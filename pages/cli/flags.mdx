# Flags

- Some flags care about the order of the flags but some don’t, so it depends on the program.
- We can combine multiple flags as shown in ls.
- `pwd --help` → help is a flag. Runs pwd in help mode.
- `ls -l` , `ls -l -a` , `ls -al`, `ls -la` , `ls --ignore snap` , `ls --ignore=snap` , `ls -I snap`
- `ls -lsah`
