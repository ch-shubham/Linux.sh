- So emulator contains the shells that are running.
- There are different shells like BASH(Bourne again shell), zsh and fish shell.
- We can use **`--help`** with literally every command to see the manual of that command.
- `pwd` is used to print the working directory.
- `cd /home , cd , cd .. , cd ~` are some commands to change the directories.
